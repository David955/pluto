# Pluto (WIP)
Text-adventure in space!


>*You look through the window, but all you can see is vast blackness of space. In reflection you see yourself. 
You are wearing standard janitor jumpsuit. 
When you look closer, you can even see your name badge. 
As you focus on it, you are disturbed with loud noises coming from behind. You turn in haste just to see...*

Pluto is console application in which I try to practice basics of C# and in process, create a small retro style computer game. 

Goals to practice/learn:
- file manipulation
- accessibility levels
- OOP
- delegates
- *later/maybe: how to put it into Unity*
